# Basics {#basics}

In this chapter you will get up and moving with your first HTML presentation 
using `xaringan`.
Specifically, we will cover the basics regarding getting started and 
generating your HTML slides, as well as talk about some markdown and 
`xaringan`-specific syntax considerations. 
Next, you will learn how to incorporate some light customizations to give 
your slides a more personal touch. 
This chapter concludes with some examples of best practices for including R 
code into your `xaringan` presentations.




## Getting started

- RMarkdown + xaringan = 😍 (general paragraph)

### From RStudio

- "File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Ninja Presentation"

### From scratch

- like any othere .Rmd file... output: xaringan::moon_reader
- "Provides an R Markdown output format xaringan::moon_reader as a 
wrapper for remark.js, and you can use it in the YAML metadata"

### Generating your slides

- knit
- infinite_moon_reader: RStudio Addin that allows you to update your slides in 
real time




## General syntax

### quick comparison with general markdown

### headers, separating slides

### Multi-column slides

- two columns
- pull left/right

### math




## Making it yours

### Images, gifs

- knitr
- background images

### Templates

- names(xaringan:::list_css())

### HTML/CSS/JS basics 

- iframes
	- include other websites, shiny apps
- basic customizations (CSS, JS)
	- colors, counters, tweets




## Incorporating R code

- analyses, plots and tables (some html widgets)
- inline
- knitr chunks
- code highlighting (`*`, `{{}}`, and `#<<`; `highlight.output`)
