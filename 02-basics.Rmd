# Basics {#basics}


Ideas so far:

* Getting started
* Creating slides
* Templates
* Images
* Inserting R code
* HTML/CSS/JS basics 
* Markdown basics (necessary?)
* R Markdown basics -> or talk about the relevant part to show difference to the usually knitting where Rmd is parsed through remark.js instead of pandoc. (ioslides is reveal.js I think?)
